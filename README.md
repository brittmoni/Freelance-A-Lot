# Freelance-A-Lot


Final Project for UNCH2019 fullstack bootcamp.

Made by:



Welcome to Freelance-A-Lot! This site is designed to connect freelancers with employers. Freelance-A-Lot allows employers (anyone who needs any technical work completed) to post job postings in order to hire freelancers. The freelancer will then be able to contact the employer and apply for the position. If the job is filled, the employer will be able to remove the posting from Freelance-A-Lot. 

Freelance-A-Lot is free for both freelancers and employers. This will allow freelancers to quickly find open positions and apply to them versus seraching online for opportunities. Give Freelance-A-Lot a try today!
